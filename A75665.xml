            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have taken the opportunity, by a Boat now going for <hi>England,</hi> with Mr <hi>Pemell,</hi> the Chirurgion of this Garri≈øon, who is ≈øent with an Addre≈øs of the Souldiery here, to the Lord <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and Council of the Army, to let you know, that without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, you cannot imagine how much the dejected, almost dying ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the well-affected people of this I≈øle have been revived, and the joy they have had by that unexpected, and almost miraculous re≈øtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the famous long-Parliament, to the exerci≈øe (once again) of their ≈øupreme trusts, from which they had been ≈øo long interrupted. And that which hath added to their joy and content, is the Advice we have received from <hi>London,</hi> which doth intimate to us, that there is very great probability, that the people of this poor I≈øland (after their long bondage and mi≈øery,) will be delivered from the heavy yoak of their pre≈øent oppre≈ø≈øors, to wit, from Col. <hi>Robert Gibbons,</hi> and Captain <hi>Richard Yeardley</hi> his Deputy, who, we are credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, appeared in <hi>London,</hi> and el≈øewhere, notorious enemies to that happy re≈øtauration. It is here affirmed, that Lieut. Col. <hi>Ma≈øon,</hi> is in nomination to be our Governour: we hear a very good report of him, and that he is a profe≈ø≈øed enemy to Tyranny. In ca≈øe he doth take care to have Officers under him, that may be thus qualified, it will be an honour to him, and great ≈øatisfaction to all the faithful of this place, who have very much ≈øuffered under the others; and would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallably ≈øuffered in a higher degree, in ca≈øe this ≈øudden alteration of things had not happened: the Bayliff and others being very much threatned, and that onely for having ≈øigned a Procuration here to ≈øome of their faithful Patriots in <hi>London,</hi> which tended onely for the good and ≈øafety of the whole I≈øland. <hi>Benjamin Dumare≈øy,</hi> the late Protector's Atturney General in this I≈øle, was very active again≈øt the ≈øaid Bayliff, and others well affected, in oppo≈øing the ≈øame in the
<pb facs="tcp:112067:3"/>behalf (as he pretended) of his Ma≈øter the Protector, and the ≈øaid <hi>Gibbons</hi> and <hi>Yeardley,</hi> to who≈øe ≈øervice he was very zealous again≈øt the publick good.</p>
            <p>Having ≈øeen by divers good things publi≈øht in print, that there are yet (after ≈øo long Apo≈øtacy) ≈øome hopes of just liberty, it hath encouraged me to ≈øend you here inclo≈øed, tho≈øe Articles of high mi≈ødemeanours again≈øt the ≈øaid <hi>Gibbons</hi> and <hi>Yeardley,</hi> who (in the life of the old Protector, ≈øo called) were ≈øent to the Pre≈øident of his Council; but nothing being done therein, 'tis judged fit, not onely by my ≈øelf, but by ≈øeveral other honest people of this I≈øle, that they might be made publick; for the performance of which, I leave it to your Judgement and Di≈øcretion, remaining</p>

               <p n="1">1. THat contrary to the ancient Charters and Priviledges of that I≈øle and Ordinances made and practi≈øed thereupon, directing the manner how the quantities of Wooll, Leather, and other Commodities granted to the I≈øland and Ca≈øtles, ought to be di≈øtributed, to wit, by the ≈øaid Governour, Deputy, Bayliff and Jurats, who thereby are ≈øtrictly injoyned to ≈øee that all Bills or Licen≈øes granted, and Returns thereupon may be regi≈øtred in the Court of <hi>Jer≈øey,</hi> by the Clark, paying for each onely 10 pence; but contrary thereunto, the ≈øaid Col. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> (without the privity of the Bayliff and Jurats, or keeping any Regi≈øtring thereof) hath granted Licences for the ≈øaid Commodities, to whom he plea≈øed, re≈øerving for him≈øelf, Allies, and particular friends, not at all rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the I≈øland or Ca≈øtles, the greate≈øt quantity: all which ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall and unju≈øt proceedings, are very much to the prejudice of the State, and to the Marchants and others of that I≈øland: to the State, becau≈øe none could controle nor check him, either in the granting and di≈øpo≈øing of the quantities of the ≈øaid Commodities, although 20 times more then is allotted to the I≈øle and Ca≈øtles, nor in the Returns which he hath made; ≈øo that any part or parcel of Wool or Leather, hath been tran≈øported or connived at by him, to be tran≈øported into <hi>France</hi> for his advantage; being impo≈ø≈øible to que≈øtion the Tran≈øporters. To the Inhabitants, becau≈øe many of them are denied the benefit of any part of the ≈øaid Licences: And mo≈øt of tho≈øe that have any, it is but by very ≈ømall parcels, as 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, Todds of Wooll, and other Commodities
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112067:4"/>proportionably; for which he hath ≈øuffered his Clarks to extort from the people one Crown for each Licence, and for the lea≈øt, half a Crown, which amounts to a con≈øiderable ≈øum of money, among≈øt the poor Inhabitants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the ≈øaid Governour, in order to ≈øatisfie his un≈øatiable ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, did contrive another unju≈øt way by fleecing the poor Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, in extorting from tho≈øe that trade out of the I≈øland ≈øix <hi>d.</hi> per head for a Pa≈ø≈øe: which Pa≈ø≈øe, was to continue but for five dayes; and then, if (by contrary winds) they were ≈øtayed, the ≈øaid Inhabitants were forced to come to the Ca≈øtles, and there take an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Pa≈ø≈øe, and pay as they did for the former; and ≈øo con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if the wind had not ≈øerved in a moneth or more, having extorted the like from all Boats that went but a fi≈øhing, or fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Sea, weed (called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rack</hi>) with which the Inhabitants do ≈øoyl their Lands: which exaction is contrary to the Charters and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of that I≈øland.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That be≈øides tho≈øe forementioned extortions, he the ≈øaid Governour found out a new one, and that very unju≈øt, and di≈øho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; (<hi>viz.</hi>) by appointing ≈øome of his Servants and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to drive away the ≈øheep of the poor Inhabitants to <hi>Mount-Orguil</hi> Ca≈øtle, there committing the poor innocent Creatures pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners, upon pretences of having tre≈øpa≈ø≈øed by entring the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the State. And that in the Winter ≈øea≈øon, and when there is no gra≈ø≈øe, and that all the Cattle is, by the ancient Lawes and Cu≈øtoms of that I≈øle, known not to be kept in at that time, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then Common, except inclo≈øures, which are kept by ≈øtrong ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: the ≈øaid Servants and Souldiers keeping tho≈øe poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, (contrary to Law, Cu≈øtoms and Equity) pri≈øoners in the ≈øaid Ca≈øtle, till the owners did relea≈øe them, by paying a Ran≈øom for each head, except for tho≈øe that were fat, which the Inhabitants could never find nor redeem again, onely the Skins of ≈øome, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been found, thrown over the walls of the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Mount-Orguil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That it is ≈øo apparant, that the ≈øaid Governour hath no other re≈øpects or care, but to advance his particular gain and profit, ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øame very openly, upon a Market day in the I≈øland, when he had the fle≈øh of two, or three, or more, fat Oxen to be ≈øold that day in the Shambles: the Butchers came to him, hearing of a great quantity of Fi≈øh taken the night before, which was coming
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112067:4"/>to the Market, telling him, that in ca≈øe he ≈øhould ≈øuffer the ≈øaid Fi≈øh to be brought and ≈øold that day, he would lo≈øe a great deal upon the ≈øale of his Beefs: whereupon, the ≈øaid Governour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding which way the Cart which brought the ≈øaid Fi≈øh, did come, commanded ≈øome of his Souldiers to ≈øtop it from coming to Market, upon a ≈øeeming pretence, that one third part thereof belonged unto him; but as ≈øoon as the Market was over, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea≈øed the ≈øaid Fi≈øh, which was a very great lo≈ø≈øe to the owners thereof.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That, contrary to Law, and by combination, the ≈øaid Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hath taken money of per≈øons in that I≈øle, to relea≈øe Leather, which he had cau≈øed to be ≈øeized from them; upon pretence, it was to be tran≈øported for <hi>France:</hi> and without any legal procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, either in declaring it to the Exchequer, or in the Court of that I≈øle, according to the ancient Cu≈øtom, hath of his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, freed the ≈øaid Leather, which afterwards was tran≈øported into <hi>France.</hi> And namely, from one <hi>John Anquetill</hi> he received 20 Crowns, or thereabouts. And to relea≈øe Shones and Boots, which his Souldiers had ≈øeized from one <hi>John Li≈øcam,</hi> twelve Crowns, and afterwards the ≈øaid Boots and Shoos were tran≈øport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
